## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was quite challenging. I learnt how to use CSS properties more explicitly. Getting the right width also proved difficult but I was able to overcome. This project challenged my wits and helped me to be more confident about my CSS knowledge.

### Continued development

- CSS Flexbox
- APIs
- Responsiveness

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.flexboxfroggy.com) - This helped me for with understanding the CSS Flexbox. The website simplified the concept and made it easier to undestand. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS in general. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
